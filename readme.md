quick sort -> partition --> pivot


left less than pivot || pivot || greater than pivot

	base case

	pivot element
	
	time complexity
	
unbalanced partition

balanced partiton

	
pivot starategy

sapce complexity of quick sort : 

time complexity : O(n logn)

sterling formula 

recurrence realtions



Tasks
Quick sort
binary search (iterative)
merge sort (Iterative)




week 4 --> session 2

subset Array
Intersection Array

solve 0,1,2 and 0,1
element repeated n times in 2n size array find the element 
spiral matrix (iteratively , recursion)



week 5 --> session 1
algorithms to live (book)

1)wave form array
2)find majority element (similar to 2n repated element);
==>VOTING ALGORITHM
-> try solve it using bit wise operations
-> try problem where majority element does not exist

3)Tower of Hanoi
	-->recursion
	-->substitution
	


//2 power 0 formula	
==>exponential summation formula 
2+4+8+32 = 2(n-1)-1;


hashing

data structure operations
insert
delete
search
sort
merge
traverse


Linear Data Structure
Array
LinkedList
Stack (FIFO)
Queue(LIFO)



OS main feature
deadlock
process management
process synchronization
memory mangement


==>Round Robin ALGORITHM
	->circular list


Explored Queue and Stack DS

Go through enjoy algorithms blogs of data structures and algorithms



week 5 --> session 2

1)Equilibrium index
	prefix array
		->any range sum quries can be solved using prefix array
  a)Many equilibrium indexes
  
  
Note: output array is not considerd as space complexity as it is part of the problem

-->solve all prefix and suffix array pattern problems

==>segment tree
	yet to be discussed

==>Hashing
	Keys are always integer internally even if it is string externally
	
==>String Folding	

->Two types of DS
  Primitive and non primitive DS

--> check which sorting algo is  stable?
-->	if it is not stable how to make them stable?

=>books to read
	alogrithms by robert sedvick(java)
	Alogrithm design manual	(steven skiena)
	ALGORITHM by CLRS
	
 -->problem of birthday , problem of dice
 
 
 
week 6 --> session 1

=>books to read
	1)CLRS -> algorithms unlocked
	2)alogrithms by robert sedvick(java)
	3)Alogrithm design manual	(steven skiena)
	4)ALGORITHM puzzlers
	
==>Hash Table
	direct addresss table I.D.S
	
1)Sorting a string 
	frequency of charecters
	fixed array of ascii chars and increase count then sort
2)string is a anagram	or not
	using fixed ascii array
task :try to solve it  single loop

3)Counting Sort

4)stable counting sort

==>Hash Function
	Hash -->(how to chooose hash function)
	collison
	how we will handle collison
	
	-->Modular hashing
		randomise hash function to minimise collision
		
	
5)how to check given num is a prime , how to find all prime num in range		
         
 
==> encoding - decoding (will be discussed later)
	
-->Computer scientists
	Donald knuth
	claude shannon

==>design hash table
		  chaining
