week 2 --> session 1 --> (04-Oct-2023)
==> complexity Analysis
		HOW , WHERE , WHY 
		 
		To understand behaviour of algo for diff input sizes
		Code optimization
		
		-->how to calculate running time of ALGORITHM
				every Programming operation will take constant time
				Large scale of input (exception => low scale)
				Independent of machine related (In terms of input size)
					hardware can be scaled  only by constant (there is saturation limit)
				Choice of programming language(compiler)
				==> All the above are mostly are constant time operations
				
				Input size
				==>varies lot
				we always analyse running time of  alogrithms wrt input size
				
		-->Running time
				total time taken by algo for particular input size
				anpow2+an+a
		-->Time complexity
				abstract(npow2) 
				
		-->Input size

		FOCUS AND CONSISTENCY
		
		  
-->Pick three subjects 
	DSA - major
	System design
	OOPS design
		

best = sigma
Average = theta
worst = Big O

BIG O ==> O(npow2); (to be discussed) 	


-->wherever  randomise factor is involved in algo we perform average case to understand it better

-->when best and worst has some gap then average needs to be calculated

-->Rate of growth of curve give is clear picture time complexity
   put higher oderd term in big O ie time complexity 

-->an + b = O(npow2)  , mathametically this equation is correct for upperbound,
	but for programming this doest help in comparing algo
	an + b = O(logn) is wrong X , this cannpt be possible
	
==>what are the assumptions in algorithms
	input Distribution
	
==>when we use best , avg , worst case
	if best and worst is O(n) then avg also will be the same
	
	for small input size lower order term and coefficeints cant be ignored
