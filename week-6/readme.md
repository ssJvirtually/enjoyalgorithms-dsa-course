Week 6 - Session 1

Books to Read:

CLRS - Algorithms Unlocked
Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick (Java)
Algorithm Design Manual by Steven Skiena
Algorithm Puzzlers
Hash Table:

Direct Address Table
I.D.S (Not sure what I.D.S stands for, please clarify)
1) Sorting a String

Frequency of Characters
Use a fixed array of ASCII characters to increase count, then sort
2) String is an Anagram or Not

Using a fixed ASCII array
Task: Try to solve it in a single loop
3) Counting Sort

4) Stable Counting Sort

Hash Function:

Hash (How to choose a hash function)
Collision
How to handle collisions
Modular Hashing
Randomize hash function to minimize collisions
5) How to check if a given number is prime and how to find all prime numbers in a range

Encoding - Decoding (To be discussed later)

Computer Scientists:

Donald Knuth
Claude Shannon
Design Hash Table:

Chaining
