week 5 --> session 1
algorithms to live (book)

1)wave form array
2)find majority element (similar to 2n repated element);
==>VOTING ALGORITHM
-> try solve it using bit wise operations
-> try problem where majority element does not exist

3)Tower of Hanoi
	-->recursion
	-->substitution
	


//2 power 0 formula	
==>exponential summation formula 
2+4+8+32 = 2(n-1)-1;


hashing

data structure operations
insert
delete
search
sort
merge
traverse


Linear Data Structure
Array
LinkedList
Stack (FIFO)
Queue(LIFO)



OS main feature
deadlock
process management
process synchronization
memory mangement


==>Round Robin ALGORITHM
	->circular list


Explored Queue and Stack DS
