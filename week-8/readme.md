### Session 2 - 17-Nov-2023

#### Linear Data Structure

- **Array**
  - *Efficient*
    - Continuous memory allocation
    - Swapping
    - Access by index
    - Locality
  - *Not Efficient*
    - Size (static allocation)

#### Linked List

- **Advantages**
  - Not fixed size
- **Sorting of Linked List**
  - Merge sort is best
- **Problems to be Solved**
  - Sort Linked List
  - Remove Duplicates

#### Explore

- Explore data structures on Array
- Numpy library
  - Parallel computing

#### Dynamic Array (List)

- **Insertion**
  - O(n)
- **Average**
  - O(1)
- **Implementation**
  - Constructor
  - Public methods: get, delete, insert
  - Private methods: resize, shrink
  - Static: growth factor, current size, threshold/limit

#### Knowledge Graph

- How to keep things in memory for longer

1. **Rotate Matrix by 90 Degrees**
   - n * n transpose can be done in place by swapping
   - m * n transpose can only be done with extra space
   - [Rotate Image](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image)

2. **KaratSuba Integer Multiplication (HW)**

3. **Calculate the xPowerN**
   - Divide it into subproblems and add the sum

#### Math Concepts to Learn

- Learn about number theory
  - Binary
  - Decimal
  - Hexadecimal
  - Base64
